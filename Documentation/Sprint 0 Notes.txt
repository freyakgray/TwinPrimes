>> POWERPOINT NOTES <<
> Software development
 ~ Approach: democratized version of Scrum; some roles are more solidly define, but we generally decide as a team
 ~ Definition of done: All functions from the prototype implemented and working successfully
 ~ Deliverables: ProjectAPI.txt
 ~ Management: Trello

> Communication
 ~ Standups: Freya does in-class standups, Lucas and Robbie do remote standups
 ~ Asynchronous: Discord for asynchronous communication, plus team meetings after every class and occasional
   team meetings outside of class

> Team Roles
 ~ Product Owner/customer - Robbie
 ~ Scrum lead is democratized; we make decisions as a group
 ~ All members will be developers
 ~ No rotation (can simply not mention rotation)

> Toolchain
 ~ Repository and approach: GitHub and ???
 ~ CI/CD: Travis
 ~ Deployment: local .exe file or online app as a stretch goal

> Plan
 ~ Minimum viable product: Prototype functions redesigned and implemented
 ~ Stretch goals:
  - GUI
  - Make it a web-based app
  - Design and implementation of pattern searching technique

> Artifacts
 ~ Planning meeting: ProjectAPI.txt, any notes you may have taken on the theory
 ~ Retrospective (what exactly do we need for this?)
 ~ Project management platform: Screenshots/links to Trello
 ~ Repo statistics: Screenshots/links to GitHub repository (going to be small, since it's mostly
   documentation so far)
 ~ CI/CD and static analysis pipeline: ???
